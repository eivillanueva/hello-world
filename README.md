# hello-world


Hi Humans!

Edgar here, I have my Bachelor of Science in Architecture and have worked in the field for 3 years as a visual designer/architectural designer. My expertise are in 3D modeling software: 3DsMax, Revit, Rhino/Grasshopper, and SketchUp and render on: MaxWell, Vray, and Unreal Engine. As a visual designer, I have also have a great length of experience in the Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign). You can check out my work at www.3ditstudio.com.

I will finish my Master of Science in Information Technology May 2016. Here I have focused on User Interface Design and Human Computer Interaction. Foundational courses in: Java I & II, Advanced Networks, Applied Database, Computer Visualization, and Human Computer Interaction. I have done web development and design with html5, css, php, javascript, d3, and mysql. 

Anyways, that's my background. I do love me some tacos!
